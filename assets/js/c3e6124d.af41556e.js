Seems like it might not max out xp since buffs and monsters might come more slowly. 2-2) run around in a loose circle to gather as many buffs as possible and not leave them behind, thus speeding up collection. 2-3) run in a straight line looking for powerups.

HM has benefits such as more resources, 30% more coin, and key chance. However HM also increases adventure difficulty more aggressively than NM. Therefore it's best to test adventure difficulty as you do HM. For me I spent 3 to 4 weeks at 31/5 just to get my legendary set together before I pushed. For me, NM is just to unlock HM."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"You get MORE exp and coin standing still. Moving lowers spawn rate. Same for Guild Event and Dungeon. Early on though you do need to move because you aren't strong enough and need your weapons asap. So as a new player you'll run to collect, but eventually as you get stronger, you'll just AFK and let auto-collect do the job for you at the end of the timer. Depending on your hero, you'd probably just move to find a suitable choke point using environmentals and once there, AFK. At times you might find a coin power up near where you want to camp; picking it up just as the warning says \"\"Big Horde Coming\"\" will give a very nice boost to coin collection."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Power ups are random.

In some cases it is obvious, like the damage tome, but for example projectile speed no one seems to have a clear answer on so far, and I would appreciate if someone could clarify. The effects of projectile speed on fire orbs and crossbow are more obvious, while on chain lighting and boomerang I find it less so, even though these weapons also include the stat in it\u2019s upgrades.
