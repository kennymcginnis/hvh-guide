# Adventure Mode

:::warning
Adventure difficulty is dynamic and parallels your chapter progression.

Hard mode progression pushes the difficulty more aggressively than normal mode.

The difficulty caps out at NM200 / HM200.

As such it is advised to progress chapters in small increments and doing adventure daily to make the judgement if you need to stop or can progress since it is possible to lock yourself out of the hero by not being able to overcome the adventure difficulty.
:::

## Adventure Mode Overview

Adventure mode is a monthly event (does not coincide with 1st to 30th of the month) that lasts 30 days, where a NEW hero is released.

Players need to advance across a chess board of tiles (stages) to reach the new hero.

Each advancement is challenged by having to survive 5 minutes and each stage has 2 positive buffs and 2 curses (debuffs).

Each attempt to advance will cost 1 ticket and the ticket <Highlight color="#b31e25">WILL</Highlight> be consumed even if you fail the stage. A <Highlight color="#178e10">victory</Highlight> will result in advancement and being rewarded with the resource for that stage.

Players start with 3 tickets and will get 1 ticket per 24 hours and <span style={{ color: 'red'}}>NO NEW</span> tickets will be earned once the cap (3/3) is reached.

F2P players have a cap of 3 tickets, as such it is recommended to progress 1 tile (stage) daily.

The hero is unlocked at tile (stage) 40, however only a maximum of 33 tickets can be accumulated by F2P, as so roughly 1300 gems are needed to advance the remaining tiles.

Ever so often players will come across a Magical Shrine where they can get a small blessing for free, or a big blessing for 200 gems.

Extra tickets can be picked up on the adventure shop along your progress. Visiting shops, unlocking gates, picking up blessings at magical shrines and rescuing the hero will not consume a ticket.

There are gates along the way to temper progress. These gates take a few hours to open after you activate the countdown. Later gates have a longer countdown clock. All countdowns can be hastened by checking in hourly to speed up the process. With each gate passed, the next section becomes more difficult.

After receiving the hero there are another 20 tiles to the end. It would cost too many gems for F2P to reach the end as such it is not a worthwhile investment.

Those who purchase the adventure pass can advance to the end to receive one of three chests.

## Gates

Along your journey you will find gates blocking your progress till you unlock them. Unlocking a gate does not require a ticket.

Each hour, the unlock timer can be sped up twice. Each speed up will shave off 1 hour for F2P players (2 hours shaved per hour), and 2 hours for those with Gold Pass (4 hours shaved per hour). Diamond Pass unlocks all gates immediately.

| Gate    | Stage | Timer    |
|---------|------:|---------:|
| First   |     3 |  6 hours |
| Second  |     6 | 12 hours |
| Third   |    13 | 24 hours |
| Fourth  |    20 | 24 hours |
| Fifth   |    28 | 24 hours |
| Sixth   |    35 | 48 hours |
| > | > | The hero is unlocked after this gate. |
| Seventh |    42 | 48 hours |
| Eighth  |    50 | 72 hours |

No further gates after this.

## How to Rescue the Hero as F2P

Adventure Mode Walkthrough Timeline at the bottom of the section

By the first few days upon adventure starting, the tier list will be updated. You can check to see how good the new hero is and decide for yourself if you want to remain F2P or purchase the Gold Pass so you can reach the end of adventure to get your hero to 2 stars and level 100 using the 100 hero shards from the chest. If you choose to remain F2P, continue reading on.

When you begin you will have 3/3 tickets. Ticket counter can be viewed at the top left of your screen.

As long as your tickets are NOT capped at 3/3, you will get 1 new ticket every 24 hours.

Therefore it is recommended to progress at least 1 tile (stage) daily. It is highly recommended to keep your ticket count at 1/3 or lower just to be safe.

The hero is rescued at once you reach Stage 40. However with the event lasting 29 to 30 days, you will get only 32 to 33 tickets (3 starter tickets + 29 or 30 daily tickets).

You will get 1 FREE ticket at the FIRST Traveling Trader shop. You will be at Stage 3 when you encounter this shop after the first gate. That adds up to 33 or 34 tickets, with 6 to 7 more stages to go. These remaining stages have to be progressed by using gems.

Along your journey, there will be TWO discounted tickets at the Traveling Trade shop. The first dicounted ticket will be at the shop when you are at Stage 3. The second discounted ticket will be at the shop when you are at Stage 19.

These discounted tickets are 150 gems each. Make sure to PURCHASE these 2 tickets when you encounter them. The final 4 to 5 stages will require using 200 gems per stage. Thus a total of 1,100 to 1,300 gems are needed.

You can earn about 3,700 gems a month so there is enough time to earn the amount needed to rescue the hero.

The remaining 5 tickets will cost 200 gems each. The minimum amount of gems required to rescue the hero will be 1,300 gems. (150 x 2 discounted tickets + 5 x 200 regular tickets = 300 + 1000 = 1,300 gems)

Visting the shops, unlocking gates, picking up bleesings at magical shrings and rescuing the hero will not consume a ticket.

Once at Stage 29 you will spend the next 4 daily tickets advancing and spend 600 gems for 3 tickets so you can reach Stage 35.  Then unlock the 48 hours gate. Use the remaining 3  daily tickets (4 if adventure lasts 30 days) and along with spending spend 200 to 400 gems (depending if adventure lasts 29 or 30 days) to reach the hero at Stage 40. (Please fine tune accordingly and do calculate on your own once you are at the 48 hours gate. You can also check the Walkthrough Timeline at the bottom of the section as a guide to proceed. If there are any mistakes with it, do let me know.)

The final few Stages before the hero might be Hard tiles. As such it will be a good idea to keep some gems on stand-by in case you need a revive, especially if you are not feeling confident.

After receiving the hero there are another 20 tiles reach the end at Stage 60. It would cost too many gems for F2P (20 x 200 = 4,000 gems) to reach the end as such it is NOT a worthwhile investment.

## Rewards

Each victory up to Stage 60 rewards you with resources. Which resource you receive will depend on which tile you decide to challenge.

Dusts and orbs are the most prized rewards. Followed by scrolls and gold less so.

Dusts ≥ Orbs > Scrolls > Gold

When you reach Stage 60, you have a choice between 3 chests. 1500 Forge Tokens, 100 Hero Shards, 750 Supers. You MUST make your choice from Stage 58 as you WILL LOSE ACCESS to one of the two side chests depending on how you advance to Stage 59.

It is generally advised to pick the 100 Hero Shards since they are the rarest resource. The others can be farmed weekly pending how far you clear Arena. You can choose Forge Tokens / Supers if they are your immediate priority and you have no interest in getting the new hero to 2 stars and Level 100 anytime soon.

## Gearing for Adventure Mode

For new players, use the highest rarity equipment you have.

You can use Knight set for more survivability. Or you can also go with Rogue set + Ranger boots for more damage. Ideally you want to jewel with Vulnerability, Ultimate Charge, Ultimate Duration, Cooldown > AoE > anything else.

You may also consider swapping certain pieces out to start with maximum upgrades: Legendary Noble Helm, Legendary Wizards Chest, Ascended Wizards Amulet. Fill the rest of the slots with what you feel you need (Knight for survivability, Rogue set + Ranger boots)

Once you are strong enough and find the difficulty manageable you can choose to wear Noble set and Key Jewels just to get keys from clearing the stages.

## Weapon Selection

The standard meta build works if you are strong enough.

If you find yourself struggling, prioritize survival weaponry: Divine Aura + Regeneration tome, Ice Wand + Life tome, Fire Orbs + Duplicator, Hammers + Crit work really well. The aim is to survive for 5 minutes afterall.

## Help, I progressed too far and difficulty is too hard

If you find yourself in this situation, there are some things you could try.

First things first: STOP ALL CHAPTER PROGRESSION

Farm hardcore to get more keys and improve your gear.

Try using Knight gear.

Level up your heroes further.

Use Super Tokens in Forge to upgrade weapons.

Use survival based heroes like Paladin, Knight and Monk. They have pushback effects and shields.

You may also consider swapping certain pieces out to start with maximum upgrades: Legendary Noble Helm, Legendary Wizards Chest, Ascended Wizards Amulet. Fill the rest of the slots with Knight gear for more survivability.

BM cheese to surive. (Check Arena tab for info)

Untested ideas: Stack lots of evasion gems. You can even try stacking movement speed jewels, run in one direction the whole 5 minutes with Dragon's Breath evo + Ice Wand evo.

At the end of the day if you cannot get past the stage, you will have to accept that you have been locked out and you MUST STOP ALL chapter progression so that you can focus on farming and getting stronger or else you will be locked out AGAIN at the NEXT adventure.
